Welcome,

I've been working with data over the past five year, most of those as manager.
I'm creating this repository so I can share with the comunity my analysis and practice a bit of coding and creating machine learning models.

On this repository you may find classification and regression models and some EDAs (Exploratory Data Analysis) all implemented with python.

Hope you enjoy!
